## Software Engineering final project 
### Measuring the leaf inclination angles of basil plants with a stereo camera

This projects measures the leaf inclination angles of basil plants with the use of a stereo camera. The point clouds generated 
with the stereo camera are used to isolate the leaves and posteriorly segment them. Lastly, the leaf inclinatin angles is measured
used two methods: the best fit plane and the surface normals.
