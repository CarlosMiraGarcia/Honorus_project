## Software Engineering - Final Project 
### Measuring the leaf inclination angles of basil plants with a stereo camera

This projects measures the leaf inclination angles of basil plants with the use of a stereo camera. The point clouds generated 
with the stereo camera are used to isolate the leaves and posteriorly segment them. Lastly, the leaf inclinatin angles is measured
used two methods: the best fit plane and the surface normals.

In order to make this project work, an Ensesno 45 stereo camera is needed in order to capture the plants' point clouds. However, a different version of the project, where the point clouds are already taken, will be uploaded.
